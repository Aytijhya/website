          <p class="description">My research interests span a broad spectrum within theory, methodology, and applications of Statistics and Machine Learning. 
            I have worked on areas including robust statistics, online/sequential learning, game-theoretic statistics,
            high-dimensional inference, change-point detection and localization, group-feature selection,
        classification algorithms, 
        nonparametric inference,
        neural networks, etc. Currently, I am also exploring causal and conformal inference. Details of my publications and preprints can also be found in my <a href="index.html">homepage</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fKv7P-wAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">

            <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> Classical density (or density-functional) estimation assumes an underlying distribution absolutely continuous w.r.t. Lebesgue measure,
               leading to poor performance for data distributions with both continuous and discrete components. We show that a simple modification of existing nonparametric methods removes
                this assumption while preserving theoretical guarantees and improving empirical results.</p>

            </a></strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> We address a fundamental but largely unexplored challenge addresses a fundamental yet underexplored question in sequential changepoint analysis: how can we perform valid inference on the changepoint, once a (potentially blackbox or heuristic) sequential detection algorithm has declared that a change has occurred? 
              Specifically, we construct confidence sets for the (unknown) changepoint using only the data available up to a data-dependent stopping time, at which an arbitrary sequential detection algorithm stops and signals a change.
               To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first general methodology for post-detection changepoint localization that is both assumption-lean and agnostic to the change detection method.</p>

              <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> We prove a general result that least favourable distribution (LFD) pairs, when they exist,
yield optimal e-values for testing arbitrary composite nulls against composite alternatives.
Then we show the following composition property of least favourable distributions: if an LFD pair exists for some composite null and alternative, then
the LFDs of Huber’s ϵ-contamination or total variation (TV) neighborhoods around that
specific pair form the LFD pair for the corresponding robustified composite
hypotheses. Furthermore, where LFDs do not exist, we develop new e-value based robust composite
tests for general settings, that are inherently sequential, but
they are new even for fixed sample sizes, giving type-I error control without any regularity
conditions.

              <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> We address the problem of testing exchangeability of a sequence of random
                variables under the recently popular framework
                of testing by betting. We design a new (yet simple) game in which
                we observe the data sequence in pairs. Even
                though betting on individual observations is
                futile, we show that betting on pairs of observations is not. We prove that
                our game leads to a nontrivial test martingale,
                which is interesting because it has been obtained by shrinking the filtration very slightly.
                We show that our test controls type-1 error despite continuous monitoring, and is consistent
                for both binary and continuous observations,
                under a broad class of alternatives.</p>

            <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> In this work, we present a novel embedded feature selection method based on a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) network and generalize it for group-feature or sensor selection problems, which can control the level of redundancy among the selected features or groups and it is computationally more efficient than the existing ones in the literature.
               Additionally, we have generalized the group lasso penalty for feature selection to encompass a mechanism for selecting valuable groups of features while simultaneously maintaining control over redundancy. We establish the monotonicity and convergence of the proposed algorithm, with a smoothed version of the penalty terms, under suitable assumptions</p>
