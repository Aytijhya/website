          <p class="description">My research interests span a broad spectrum within algorithms, theory, and applications of Statistics and Machine Learning. 
            I have worked on areas including robust statistics, online/sequential learning, game-theoretic statistics,
            high-dimensional inference, change-point detection and localization, causal inference,
        conformal prediction,
        classification, 
        clustering algorithms, 
        multi-armed bandits,
        neural networks. My research work appears (or under review) in the top proceedings in ML/AI (AISTATS, ECML-PKDD) and the top journals in ML and statistics and related areas (Neurocomputing, JASA, IEEE).

            <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> We focus on post-detection inference on change points, particularly on developing a hypothesis test for false alarms and a
              confidence interval of the change point in the online or sequential setting, where we have access to data only
              up to a data-dependent stopping time, where an online/sequential change-detection algorithm stops.</p>

              <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> We address the problem of testing exchangeability of a sequence of random
                variables under the recently popular framework
                of testing by betting. We design a new (yet simple) game in which
                we observe the data sequence in pairs. Even
                though betting on individual observations is
                futile, we show that betting on pairs of observations is not. We prove that
                our game leads to a nontrivial test martingale,
                which is interesting because it has been obtained by shrinking the filtration very slightly.
                We show that our test controls type-1 error despite continuous monitoring, and is consistent
                for both binary and continuous observations,
                under a broad class of alternatives.</p>

            <h3><strong>Group-Feature (Sensor) Selection With Controlled Redundancy Using Neural Networks</strong> [Neurocomputing, 2024]</h3>
            <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> In this work, we present a novel embedded feature selection method based on a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) network and generalize it for group-feature or sensor selection problems, which can control the level of redundancy among the selected features or groups and it is computationally more efficient than the existing ones in the literature.
               Additionally, we have generalized the group lasso penalty for feature selection to encompass a mechanism for selecting valuable groups of features while simultaneously maintaining control over redundancy. We establish the monotonicity and convergence of the proposed algorithm, with a smoothed version of the penalty terms, under suitable assumptions</p>

              <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> In this work, we developed robust, computationally efficient, and tuning-free classifiers
                tailored for high-dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data, using the concepts of angular distance and generalized
                energy distance. It is shown that they yield perfect classification in the HDLSS asymptotic regime (where sample size is fixed but the dimension approaches infinity), under some fairly general conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> We first modify Huber's robust SPRT for simple nulls and alternatives to instead employ a test supermartingale. 
                   The martingale tools allow us to generalize the usual Huber contamination model to show that our sequential test retains type-I error validity even under sequentially adaptive contaminations under the null. 
                    With this building block in place, we extend our approach to handle both composite nulls and composite alternative hypotheses, a task which has not been undertaken earlier, and utilizes te idea of reverse information projection. 
                    In all cases, we analyze the growth rate under the alternative, which asymptotically converges the optimal non-robust growth rate (a certain KL divergence between null and alternative).</p>
